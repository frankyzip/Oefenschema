Dynamic Music Practice Schedule Calendar (Concept) Beta

Lots of changes needs to be done

This program helps musicians plan, manage, and track their practice schedules. It provides a
calendar where practice days are marked, and music pieces scheduled for each day are
displayed. Additionally, practice days can be adjusted flexibly if a planned session is missed.

Main Features:

1. Dynamic Calendar View
• Users can navigate between different months.
• Each month is correctly structured with the appropriate start day and number of days.
• Days from the previous and next months are displayed in a lighter color.
• Practice days are highlighted along with the titles of the scheduled music pieces.

2. Adding and Editing Practice Schedules
• Users can create practice schedules and assign them to specific days.
• Multiple music pieces can be scheduled on the same day.
• Practice schedules can be saved and modified later.

3. Shifting Practice Days When Sessions Are Missed
• If a user misses a practice day, the program can automatically shift all future sessions
by an adjustable number of days.
• Users can specify how many days the sessions should be postponed (e.g., by 1 or
several days).
• The program updates all future practice days automatically.
• This ensures that no practice session is lost and keeps the schedule flexible.

4. Printing & PDF Export
• The calendar can be saved as a PDF file.
• This is done by capturing a screenshot of the calendar and inserting it into a PDF
document.
• The month name is added as a title at the top of the PDF.
• The file is saved by default on the desktop.

5. Easy Navigation and Overview
• Users can easily navigate between months using buttons.
• The calendar updates and reloads each time.
• An overview window displays all practice sessions in a list, allowing users to quickly
see when and what they need to practice.
How It Works:1. Start the program: The calendar automatically opens to the current month.
2. Add practice schedules through the main program (Form1).
3. View and edit practice days: Scheduled music pieces appear on the calendar.
4. Shift practice days if needed:
o If a practice day is missed, the user can select an option to shift all future
practice days by X number of days.
o The program automatically reschedules all sessions.
o This prevents practice sessions from being skipped and keeps the schedule
flexible.

5. Navigate to previous or next months to view the complete schedule.

6. Print the calendar or export it to a PDF to keep a detailed overview.

This program is perfect for musicians who want a flexible and adjustable practice schedule.
With the ability to shift sessions when needed, the schedule remains dynamic and tailored to
the user's needs
